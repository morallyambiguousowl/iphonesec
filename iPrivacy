iPhone Privacy & Security Tweaks
This will be less intricate and less instructions in comparison with the droidsec repository.
None of these instructions require jailbreaking your device. While jailbreaking may provide some useful
tools for privacy, security (typically a pro to using Apple) is reduced.

For the ease of following, I'll go in chronological order from the settings.

  Bluetooth - Off (unless using)
  Cellular
    Turn off data for any application that does not need roaming internet (ie. Calender, Music)
